8-Puzzle Problem Solver

This Python program is designed to solve the classic 8-puzzle problem using the A* search algorithm. The 8-puzzle is a sliding puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with eight numbered tiles and one blank tile. The goal is to rearrange the tiles from a given initial state to reach a specified goal state by sliding the tiles into the empty space.

The program prompts the user to input the initial state of the puzzle dynamically and then employs the A* search algorithm with the Manhattan distance heuristic to find the optimal solution. Once the solution is found, it displays the sequence of moves required to reach the goal state.

This project demonstrates how to implement the A* search algorithm in Python to solve the 8-puzzle problem, showcasing concepts of problem-solving, data structures, and algorithms.
