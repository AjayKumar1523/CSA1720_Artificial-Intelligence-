Description:

This Python program implements the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm for a Tic Tac Toe game where the computer plays against the player. 
  The Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm is an optimization technique for the Minimax algorithm, which reduces the number of nodes evaluated in 
  the search tree by eliminating branches that are guaranteed not to affect the final decision.

The program defines players as X and O, represents an empty space on the board as -, and includes winning combinations to check for a winner.

The alpha_beta_pruning function recursively evaluates all possible moves using the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm. 
  It returns the best score for the maximizing player (X) and the worst score for the minimizing player (O).

The best_move function finds the best move for the computer using the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm.

The main function allows the player to make moves and plays against the computer. 
  The computer uses the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm to determine its moves.
