Key Components:

Graph Class:

Defines a Graph class with an adjacency list representation to store the graph's vertices and their neighbors.
Provides methods to add edges between vertices and to perform BFS traversal starting from a given vertex.
add_edge Method:

Adds an edge between two vertices in the graph.
If a vertex is not present in the adjacency list, it adds the vertex and initializes its list of neighbors.
bfs Method:

Performs BFS traversal starting from a specified start vertex.
Uses a queue to keep track of vertices to visit next.
Visits each vertex once, marking it as visited and appending it to the traversal list.
Utility Functions:

alphabet_to_integer: Converts alphabet characters (A-Z) to integers (1-26) for vertex representation.
integer_to_alphabet: Converts integers back to alphabet characters.
User Input:

Asks the user for input to create the graph.
Prompts the user to input the number of edges and the vertices and their neighbors.
Converts the input vertices to integers for internal representation.
BFS Traversal:

Initiates BFS traversal from the specified start vertex entered by the user.
Converts the resulting traversal sequence from integers back to alphabet characters for better readability.
Example Usage:

The user inputs the number of edges and the vertices with their neighbors to create a graph.
Specifies the starting vertex for BFS traversal.
The BFS traversal sequence starting from the specified vertex is computed and displayed.
Conclusion:

This Python code provides a straightforward implementation of the BFS algorithm for traversing a graph. 
It demonstrates how BFS can be used to find the shortest path from a start vertex to all reachable vertices in a graph. 
The code can be adapted and extended for various graph-related applications,
such as finding connected components, determining reachability, or solving network problems.
