This Python code defines a class Graph for representing a graph using an adjacency list and provides methods to 
perform depth-first search (DFS) traversal starting from a specified vertex. 
It also includes functions to convert between alphabets and integers, assuming vertices are labeled with alphabets.

The Graph class has methods to add edges between vertices and to perform DFS traversal. 
The DFS traversal starts from a given vertex and visits all vertices reachable from it, recording the traversal sequence.

The program takes user input to construct the graph by specifying the number of edges and the vertices and their neighbors. 
It then prompts the user to enter a starting vertex for the DFS traversal. After the traversal is performed, 
it converts the integer representation of vertices back to alphabets for readability and prints the DFS traversal sequence.
