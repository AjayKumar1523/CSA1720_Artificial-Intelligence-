This program demonstrates how to implement a Decision Tree classifier using scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library in Python.

We first load the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset for classification tasks.
Next, we split the dataset into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.
We then create a Decision Tree classifier using the DecisionTreeClassifier class.
We train the Decision Tree classifier on the training data using the fit method.
After training, we make predictions on the testing set using the predict method.
Finally, we evaluate the performance of the classifier by calculating the accuracy score using the accuracy_score function from scikit-learn.
Decision Trees are versatile and interpretable models used for both classification and regression tasks. They work by recursively partitioning the 
  feature space into regions, based on the feature values, to make predictions. The decision tree splits the dataset into branches based on the feature 
    that provides the most significant information gain at each node. This process continues recursively until a stopping criterion is met, 
such as reaching a maximum depth or having minimum samples per leaf.
