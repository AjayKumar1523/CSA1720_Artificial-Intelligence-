Description:
This Python program implements the classic Tic Tac Toe game where two players take turns marking empty squares in a 3x3 grid with their respective symbols ('X' or 'O'). 
  The first player to align three of their symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game. 
  If all squares are filled and no player has aligned three symbols, the game ends in a tie.

The game logic is encapsulated within the TicTacToe class, which handles the game board, available moves, checking for a winner, and making moves.

Players are represented by the HumanPlayer and RandomComputerPlayer classes, allowing for human vs. computer or computer vs. computer gameplay.
  The HumanPlayer class prompts the user for input to make a move, while the RandomComputerPlayer class randomly selects an available move.

The play function orchestrates the gameplay, alternating between players until a winner is determined or the game ends in a tie.

The program can be run directly, allowing users to play against the computer, with moves and game status displayed in the console.
