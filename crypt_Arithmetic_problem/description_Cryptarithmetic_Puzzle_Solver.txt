Cryptarithmetic Puzzle Solver

This Python program solves cryptarithmetic puzzles, where letters are replaced with digits to form a valid mathematical equation. The program takes an array of words representing operands and a target word representing the sum. It then systematically explores all possible mappings of letters to digits to find a solution.

Approach:

The program encodes strings into numeric representations based on the given mappings of letters to digits.
It generates all possible permutations of digits and checks if the equation holds true for any permutation.
Utilizing a brute-force approach, the program iterates through all possible permutations to find a valid mapping that satisfies the equation.
Key Functions:

encode_string(string, char_to_num): Encodes a string into a numeric representation based on the given mapping of letters to digits.
is_mapping_possible(arr, S): Checks if a valid mapping exists for the given array of words and target word.
Example:

For the puzzle "SEND + MORE = MONEY", each letter is represented by a unique digit, and the program finds a valid mapping that satisfies the equation.
Conclusion:
Cryptarithmetic puzzles challenge logical reasoning and systematic exploration. This program, leveraging Python's itertools and brute-force techniques, efficiently tackles these puzzles and provides solutions.

Usage:

Users can input cryptarithmetic puzzles as arrays of words and a target word. The program then generates mappings of letters to digits to solve the puzzle.
This program serves as a useful tool for solving cryptarithmetic puzzles and demonstrates the power of Python in tackling such challenges.
