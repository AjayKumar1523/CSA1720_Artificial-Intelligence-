Description:
This Python program implements the Minimax algorithm for a Tic Tac Toe game against a computer opponent. 
  The Minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm used in two-player turn-based games to determine the optimal move for the current player.

The minimax function recursively explores all possible game states up to a certain depth, evaluating each states utility (score) to determine the best possible move. 
  It assumes both players play optimally, with the maximizing player trying to maximize the score and the minimizing player trying to minimize it.

The check_winner function checks if there is a winner in the current board state or if the game is still ongoing. 
  The get_best_move function uses the minimax algorithm to find the best move for the computer player.

The program allows the user to play against the computer. After each move, the program checks for a winner or a tie and prints the current state of the board. 
  If the user enters an invalid move, the program prompts for input again.
