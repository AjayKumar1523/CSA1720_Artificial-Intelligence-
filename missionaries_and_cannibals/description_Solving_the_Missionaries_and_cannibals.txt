Title: Solving the Missionaries and Cannibals Problem with Depth-First Search

Description:

The provided Python code presents a solution to the classic Missionaries and Cannibals problem using a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. This problem involves transporting three missionaries and three cannibals from the left bank of a river to the right bank using a boat, ensuring that the cannibals never outnumber the missionaries on either side of the river at any time. The boat can carry a maximum of two passengers.

Components:

State Class:

Represents the state of the problem, including the number of missionaries and cannibals on each side of the river and the position of the boat.
Defines methods for checking validity, equality, hashing, and string representation of states.
get_successors Function:

Generates successor states based on the current state, representing possible moves of the boat.
Ensures that generated states are valid according to the problem constraints.
dfs Function:

Performs depth-first search recursively to explore possible states until a solution is found or all states are exhausted.
Prints each state visited during the search process.
solve Function:

Initializes the problem with an initial state and initiates the DFS search.
Returns True if a solution is found, otherwise False.
Usage:

The code can be executed to find a solution to the Missionaries and Cannibals problem.
It prints each state visited during the search process and indicates whether a solution exists.
Conclusion:
By leveraging a depth-first search algorithm, the provided Python code efficiently navigates through the state space of the Missionaries and Cannibals problem, determining whether a valid solution exists. This implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of DFS in solving constraint satisfaction problems and highlights its application in real-world scenarios.
