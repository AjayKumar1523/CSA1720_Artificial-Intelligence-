Title: Vacuum Cleaner Simulation: Cleaning an Environment

Description:

The provided Python code simulates the behavior of a vacuum cleaner navigating and cleaning an environment represented as a grid. The vacuum cleaner moves around the grid, detecting and cleaning dirty squares until all squares are clean.

Key Components:

VacuumCleaner Class:

Represents the vacuum cleaner entity, initialized with the environment grid.
Tracks the current position of the vacuum cleaner within the grid.
clean Method:

Executes the cleaning process by continuously searching for dirty squares and moving to clean them.
Stops when all squares in the environment are clean.
find_dirty_square Method:

Searches the environment grid for the first occurrence of a dirty square.
Returns the row and column coordinates of the dirty square.
move_to_square Method:

Moves the vacuum cleaner to the specified target square using simple directional movements (up, down, left, right).
display_environment Method:

Displays the current state of the environment grid, showing the locations of clean and dirty squares.
Example Usage:

Initializes the environment grid with dirty and clean squares.
Creates a VacuumCleaner object with the environment grid.
Initiates the cleaning process by calling the clean method.
Conclusion:

This Python code provides a basic simulation of a vacuum cleaner cleaning an environment represented as a grid. It demonstrates the principles of navigation and task execution in a simple autonomous agent scenario. This code can be expanded and enhanced with additional features, such as obstacle detection, intelligent path planning, and real-time sensor feedback, to create more sophisticated vacuum cleaner simulations.
